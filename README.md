Purchase Request System Application

This is the single page application that I created as the capstone project for my part-time java bootcamp.
The SQL script, which creates the database, is also included in this repository.

This Purchase Request System can be used by a company to display a list of users, vendors, products and requests. The users can be a reviewer or an administrator. The reviewer can review the requests of the other users but not there own.
